Independent study in chosen topic in Data Science

## Goals

Prepare for master thesis work

* Get comfortable executing machine learning research
* Setup and test workflow for report writing and publishing
* Build background knowledge
* Ideas for usecase/case-study in thesis

Outputs

* One or more demonstrations (video, in browser)
* Report(s) published as HTML
* Presentation given for Data Science class
* A set of blogpost covering the topic

## Topic ideas

* Machine hearing. Machine learning on audio data. See [DCASE2018 work](../dcase2018).
Focus on: Robust methods, can be used in real-life noisy environments.
Efficient methods, can be implemented in embedded system.
* ?

### Machine hearing

Applications/usecases
Summary of current situation (where is state-of-the-art, wrt where should go)

(skippable) What is sound / how does it work
(skippable) What is machine learning

Overview of audio features
Criterias for good features
Data augmentation
Example/typicall processing pipelines

Practical considerations
