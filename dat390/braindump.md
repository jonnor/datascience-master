## Backwards planning

Goal:
Solve basic Audio Event Detection problem

How to formulate the problem?

- N second sample of digital audio
- mono
- single-label, n-ary classification
- supervised learning. Weakly labelled

What feature representation and classifier to use?

- melspec + CNN
- melspec + learned kernels + RF
- melspec + summarizations + RF
- MFCC+delta + GMM + linear
- low-level features

'what is information, what is noise'
Information
- frequency distribution
- frequency modulations, volume modulations
Noise
- frequency response variation

How to pre-process the data?

- log/power transform spectrograms
- normalize volume
- spectral mean subtraction

What particular challenges are there with audio?

- audio mixtures, additive, bounces around
- many sources, few microphones
- reverberation
- signal distance dependent
- high dynamic range
- hearing not so well understood as vision?
- time-series. Has a temporal dimension

Things dont really need to know

- How human hearing works
- Details on how acoustic works
- multi-channel,multi-sensor recording

## Format
30 minutes presentation. 15 minutes questions.
1 picture per slide, 30 slides.

## Goal
After reading this report

> a machine learning practitioner
> 
> without prior knowledge about sound
> or digital signal processing
> 
> can solve basic Audio Event Detection problems

## Musical genre classification
AUDIO. What genre is this?

## Problem formulations
Audio search. Find similar


## Code test

```python
def read_readme():
    readme = os.path.join(project_dir, 'README.md')
    with open(readme, encoding='utf-8') as f:
        long_description = f.read()

    return long_description
```

## Image test

![Some text](./plot.png)


## Formula test

Inline equations like $x=\sin{\phi}$ are great.
But many things are better presented in a block.

$$\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)\ e^{-2\pi i x \xi}\,dx,$$

## Table test

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |




# Report

## Setup

Need

* Graphs. From matplotlib
* Tables. From pandas.DataFrame
* Images. From file or generated by Python
* Formulas written in LaTex
* Code. With highlighting. Python
* Citations

### Solution
pandoc?

Either have a Python script/command which re-generates all plots.
Or use an integrated thing like:

* https://github.com/LaurentRDC/pandoc-pyplot
* https://github.com/hertogp/imagine

## Presentation

Need:

* Audio playback
* Primary output web, PDF export second
* Images. Preferably including SVG
* Code. With highlighting. Python
* LaTex formulas

Want:

* Markdown input
* CSS styling
* Table support
* Video playback

### Solution
pandoc with reveal-js output?

Might need some adaptation for audio support?

https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/810
https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/tree/master/audio-slideshow

alternatives:

* https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md
* pandoc with Beamer output
