## Scope

Technical focus is primarily Passive Acoustic sensors,
where each sensor works indepdendently with one or a few microphones.
No active transducer.

Multichannel audio is within scope, but multi-sensor microphone fusion is out-of-scope. 
Acoustic data can be transmitted in fluids.


The application area focus is monitoring of domestic animals in farming,
and monitoring of wildlife.

Several aspects of the design may be transferrable to other medium-bandwidth sensor technologies,
such as vibration/accelerometer data or low-resolution imaging (visible,infrared).
This is generaly out-of-scope, but it may be relevant to comment briefly on this in the report.
