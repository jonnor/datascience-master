Future Farm project
Value prop..

Nordby Technology A/S,
is evaluating the technical and economic feasibility of a new subsidiary delivering
acoustic IoT sensors and audio analytics. 

TODO: background

Wireless Acoustic Sensor Network (WASN)
Internet of Things (IoT)


## Deliverables
The main deliverable is a Design Document which specifies:

* Requirements and desirable characteristics of a WASN
* Targeted usecases and scope of solution 
* Design choices made, including their background
* Overall system architecture
* Chosen technology for system components

Design aspects are expected to include:

* Network architecture and communication method
* Sensor nodes
* Data storage
* Data processing architecture
* Data analysis methods

## Scope
Passive acoustic
Primarily independent

Several aspects of the design may be transferrable to other medium-bandwidth sensor technologies,
such as vibration/accelerometer data or low-resolution imaging (visible,IR).
It may be relevant to comment briefly on this in the report.

## Activities
The project is comprised of the following key activities

* Gathering Requirements 
* Review of available technology 
* Review of academic literature
* Modelling of key design choices
* Writing the Design Document
