# TIP260: Digital fabrication 2


## Project

Should support an ongoing efforts:

* Embedded Machine Learning (master thesis)
* TapeCore fabricatable machines
* Bioplastic production & recycling

Should be designed, manufactured, tested and documented within 3 weeks.

### Ideas

EmbeddedML

* Casing for first sensor data collector.
* Power harvesting module. [Hackaday Challenge](https://hackaday.io/prize/details#two)

TapeCore

* Jig for making pulleys perfectly round. Fits onto NEMA17
* CNC-milled 3d-printer based on TapeCore

Bioplastic

* PreciousPlastic shredder redesign for wood + metal inserts.
* Flat-filament hotend + extruder. Partially designed already
* Profile dies for Filastruder. Hollow circle, square tube, 20x20 prof
* Extruder for profile extrusions.
Challenging to make the screw? Maybe it can be milled in slices?
