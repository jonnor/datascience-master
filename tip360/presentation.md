## Occupational noise

> Noise experienced by workers 

**EU Directive 2003/10/EC - noise**

Covers everything from office work to industrial labor.

## Norwegian regulations

![](./images/tiltaksgrenser-arbeidsmiljo.png)

Forskrift om tiltaks- og grenseverdier $2-1, ArbeidsmiljÃ¸loven $4-4 

## Environmental noise

> Noise pollution in general environment

**EU Directive 2002/49/EC**

Covers residential areas.
Also relevant for hospitals, schools, kindergardens.

## Norwegian regulations

Buildings (Byggteknisk forskrift, NS 8175.2008)

* Leq_24h `< 30db` (new)
* Leq_24h `< 35dB/42db` (old) 

Environment (Forurensningsloven)

* Lden `< 55 dB`

## Health impact

* Hearing impairment
* Reduced concentration
* Increased stress
* Sleep disturbance
* Increased blood pressure
* Heart problems

## Environmental noise in Europe

* Increasing problem
* Road traffic the biggest source
* 125 million affected by road noise above Lden=55dB
* 37 million road noise above Lden=65dB
* 56 million affected at night (Lnight>50dbA)

EEA: Population exposure to environmental noise

## Continious monitoring

![](./images/cesva-ta120.png)

Lowest price found: 2000 EUR

# Project

## Problem statement

> Design a wireless sensor node for environmental noise monitoring.

* Running only on battery power
* Does not require user-provided network 
* Ability to identify noise source

# Requirements

## Costs

* Unit production costs. **<1000 NOK**
* Installation. **<1000 NOK**
* Running costs. **<1000 NOK/year**

## Sound Level Measurements

* Continious sound level monitoring. **LAeqT**
* Tolerance should be within **IEC 61672, Class 2** 
* Measurement resolution: **per minute** or better
* Latency: **Reported daily** or more often

## Physical

* **1 year+** battery lifetime, rechargable
* Weatherproofing grade. **IP55+** (IEC 60529)
* **Easily mountable** on flat surface, such as a wall.
* **Aestethically acceptable** for office/restaurant/home

# Design

## Hardware architecture

![](./images/hw-blocks-black.png){ height=500px }

Power budget: **<1mA**

## Bill of Materials

![](./images/bom.png)

Total: 84 USD, 756 NOK

## Energy source

![](./images/4x18650.jpg)

1mA@365 days = 8760 mAh. 4x18650 = 12800 mAh

::: notes
Battery size: 68x72x18 mm
Total unit: ~100x100x25 mm
:::

## Connectivity

Using 2G/GPRS with COM4.no (alt: 4G/NB-IoT)

| Type  | Data/day | Cost/month |
| ------- |:-------:|-----:|
| Leq minute | 1.5 kB | 13 NOK |
| Leq sec/8 | 691.2 kB |  51 NOK  |

But, second/8 takes too much power!

## Software architecture

![](./images/processing-blocks.png)

SoundLevel measured continuously, NoiseIdentification on-demand.

## Microphone response

![](./images/mic-response.png)

IP55 rated elecret mic. Looks to be within Class 2.

# Prototype

## Proto1

![](./images/proto1-front.jpg){ height=500px }

## Inside

* Based on Nordic Thingy52 devkit
* BLE4.2 + GPRS modem
* Digital MEMS microphone. Not Class2!
* 1400mAh battery.
* CNC milled enclosure. IP22

## Installed

![](./images/proto1-installed.jpg)

# Conclusions

## Feasibility

**Possible** to implement a sensor node with
production, installation and running cost under 1000 NOK.

By running *only on battery* and using *cellular connectivity*.

Existing research indicates identification of noise source
possible using standard 1/3 octave acoustic measurement.

## Learned

* Need very big batteries for always-on measurements
* Unable to provide *Short Leq* (8 per second) measurements
* Microphone consumes majority of energy!
Can one do periodic sampling? As a mode?


# Bonus

## Technical TODOs

Goal: Customer demo ready

* Firmware: `Leq` calculation
* Firmware: Transmit using 2G modem
* Android app for bridging BLE data to web
* Minimal webinterface for sensor data

## Market TODOs

Market research for different segments

* Restaurants/hotels/AirBnB 
* Schools/kindergardens/hospitals
* Road/rail/construction/industry
* Consumers experiencing noise (road/rail etc)

## Energy harvesting

Possible through external power connector.

* Solar/wind power
* Streetlights

## Other usecases

For acoustic sensors

* Traffic estimation
* Structural montoring
* Predictive maintenance
