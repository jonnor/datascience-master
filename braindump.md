Robotics

* [Deep reinforcement for robotics](https://www.facebook.com/nipsfoundation/videos/1554594181298482)
Reinforcement learning is different from supervised methods. The agent observes its environment and performs actions on it.
It observes the outcome of its actions and compares this with desired outcome.
Current RL algorithms are fully generic (mathematically). They can get superhuman performance, but the learning efficiency is very low.
Can we make it more efficient by making use of particular information about the environment. Ie: obey our laws of physics
Can we meta-reinformcement learn? That let the agent learn to reinformcement learn?
Using Recurrent Neural Net as a generic compute achitecture, with both compute and storage ability. 
Evaluating on Multi-armed bandit problem, and known asymptomatically optimall algorithm.
Currently meta-learning works 2/3 of the time. Reasons for not working inlclude overfitting (or underfitting), and insufficient signal.
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning.
Imitation learning. Many success stories in robotics. Human shows how to perform task, agent learns the policy.
Lifelong learning. Instead of only training/learning up-front, will learn continiously after deployment.
Simulation is very important. Huge advantages to training in real world.
Challenge is for the learnings in simulation to transfer over into real world.
One approach is randomized simulation domains. With enough variation - even when not high fidelity,
allows to train agent which performs well on real-life scenario without any real-life training data.
How to increase signal for reinformement learning?
Hindsight Experience Replay. Also learn from failures. Inject goals into old experiences
* [Amit's thoughts on pathfinding](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html).
Detailed and well explained use of A* for pathfinding in games, including practical considerations.
Chosing heuristics function, its values. Tie breaking, data structures, making behavior interesting
* [Visual foresight](https://sites.google.com/view/visual-foresight).
Robots using real-time predictions of the visual/camera stimuly to learn how to perform tasks.

Computer vision

* [Bilateral_Filtering](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/MANDUCHI1/Bilateral_Filtering.html).
When performed in CIE-Lab gives very natural blurring, not introducing new colors. Also preserves edges and shadows well.
Can be applied iteratively, which effectively reduces the amount of colors present. Reducing/removing texture.
Could be used as a pre-processing step to color quantize an image? 

Efficiency

* [Optimizing fixed-point FIR filters](https://se.mathworks.com/help/dsp/examples/optimized-fixed-point-fir-filters.html),
by quantizing filter coefficients.  
* [dspguru FIR implementation](https://dspguru.com/dsp/faqs/fir/implementation/), some tricks in C
* [TIIR filters](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/tiirts/TIIR_Filters.html), truncated IIRs.
Using two IIRs to get the response of an FIR filter, but with fewer calculations.

Dealing with lack of (labeled) data

* Self learning. [Using Pseudo labeling for semi-supervised learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/simple-explanation-of-semi-supervised-learning-and-pseudo-labeling-c2218e8c769b).
After having trained model on labeled data, run it on the unlabeled data to get (pseudo) labels, then train it on the combined setup. Up to 25% pseudo labels in a batch. When method provides confidence score, take only the most confident samples into training set.
Also called .
* Semi-supervised learning can be done using a generative model, like Gaussian mixture, Naive Bayes, Hidden Markov.
Cluster-and-label: Use a clustering algorithm (unsupervised), take the labels of the majority of labeled data.
[Introduction to semi-supervised learning](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/pub/sslicml07.pdf).
Can define a graph of similarities.
* Co-training. Semi-supervised learning. Each sample is encoded with two strong and different features, ie text and image.
Train one classifier per feature, then have the two classifiers teach eachother. Multiview 
* Active learning. Training phase done in batches, most important/pivotal candidates then labeled.
[Novak 2010](http://vhosts.eecs.umich.edu/ssp2012/nowak.pdf), active learning using binary search in low-rank embedding space.
* Generative Adverserial learning. Is/can it be used outside of GAN?
* Human/user-in-the-loop. Ask the user about the correct label
* Synthesising samples. Oversampling: duplicate some samples as-is.
Randomly sample attributes.
SMOTE, especially for balancing minority classes.
Example: [librosa sound augmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/huseinzol05/sound-augmentation-librosa)
* Programmatic supervision. Distant supervision. 
* Weak supervision. [Data Programming](http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/pubs/snorkel-nips2016.pdf)
generates labels that are noisy and possibly conflicting, then learns the inaccuracies.
