# Machine Learning on Microcontrollers
Initial research happening in [EmbeddedML](./embeddedml),
to be distilled into a Master Thesis here.


## Title

Efficient audio classification using general-purpose microcontrollers

## Problem statement

How to make (cost,power) efficient audio classification
for real-time use on microcontroller?

Scope:

Focused on Convolutional Neural Networks as a base/framework
