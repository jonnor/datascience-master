## TODO

Report

* Fix image text on all existing images
* Add references introduction
* Add references priority sections

* Run spellcheck
* Run grammar checker

Study

* Clean up RF max notebook
* Report the RF max classifier
* Get one detector to work

## Learnings

- Collecting references take a long time.
- Making images take a long time.
- Writing the text is slow, and needs multiple passes.
- Keep experiments short and simple. Finish them well in time before needing to write about them
- Dont know how done experiements are before writing about them.
Write about them early to uncover weak spots.
- Images tend to jump around with Latex/Pandoc.
Best is to scale them down so they are easier to layout. Eg 3inch wide or 6 inch wide.
Can set Print Size in GIMP. Very manual, would be nice to have script to automate.
