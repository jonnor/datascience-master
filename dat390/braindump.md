# Backwards planning

Goal:
Solve basic Audio Event Detection problem

How to formulate the problem?

- N second sample of digital audio
- mono
- single-label, n-ary classification
- supervised learning. Weakly labelled

Feature extraction

- Frames. Cut up clip into smaller steps of time.
- On each frame, calculate some features
- Summarize frame features across entire clip

'what is information, what is noise'
Information
- frequency distribution
- frequency modulations, volume modulations
Noise
- frequency response variation

How to pre-process the data?

- log/power transform spectrograms
- normalize volume
- spectral mean subtraction

What classifier to use?

- 

What particular challenges are there with audio?

- audio mixtures, additive, bounces around
- many sources, few microphones
- reverberation
- signal distance dependent
- high dynamic range
- hearing not so well understood as vision?
- time-series. Has a temporal dimension

Things dont really need to know

- How human hearing works
- Details on how acoustic works
- multi-channel,multi-sensor recording

Part 1: 
* 1p. Introduction. Purpose,Scope,"who is it for".
* 2p. Background. Sound. Acoustics. Production. Aquisition. Digital representation.
* 1p. Applications.
* 1p. Problem formulations.
* 2p. Feature extraction.

* 1p. Data augmentation
=9p

Part 2: Case study
* 1p. The task. Bird audio classification
* 1p. Evaluation/comparison methodology
* 2p. Different Methods.
* 1p. Results
=5p



## Setup

Need

* Graphs. From matplotlib
* Tables. From pandas.DataFrame
* Images. From file or generated by Python
* Formulas written in LaTex
* Code. With highlighting. Python
* Citations

### Solution
pandoc.

Either have a Python script/command which re-generates all plots.
Or use an integrated thing like:

* https://github.com/LaurentRDC/pandoc-pyplot
* https://github.com/hertogp/imagine
