## Milestone 1: Ready for experimentation

Setup project infrastructure

- Move project to dedicated git repo
- Setup skeleton of report Latex/Markdown
- Setup Travis CI

Test & choose datasets

- Make a shortlist to consider
- Download the datasets, explore the data
- Make a trivial model, run against each
- Decide evaluation metrics

Test CNN model on microcontroller

- Order STM32 devkits
- Test standard models examples on STM32 devkits
- Test a trivial custom model with SMT32CubeAI

Methodology proposal

- Write it
- Ask Oliver/Kristian for feedback

## Done

- Installed STM32Cube AI toolchain, and build STM32 AI examples (HAR)
