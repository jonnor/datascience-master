# TIP260: Digital fabrication 2

## Project

Should ideally be related to an ongoing efforts:

* Embedded Machine Learning (master thesis)
* TapeCore fabricatable machines
* Bioplastic production & recycling

Should be designed, manufactured, tested and documented within 3 weeks.

## Background
Modernization of commercial cargo port in Moss,
using a nearby "dryport" where most of the cargo is stored. 
On-demand transportation, with high degree of automation.

Considerations

* How to create an efficient system?
* How to minimize negative impact on the city?

Understanding the problem

* How long are containers stored at the port? Averages,distribution.
Which factor drives this up/down? How can these be influenced?


#### Traffic impacts

* Pollution. Dust, CO2
* Noise. Sound level
* Road wear. Weight of car, Number of cars
* Accidents. Speed of cars, road/weather conditions, temperature,humidity

#### Vehicle detection

Sensor tech

* Ultrasound
* Piezoelectric
* Inductive loop
* Magnetic
* Infrared, active
* Millimeter radar
* Pnenumatic tubes
* Video analysis
* Bluetooth detection
* Cellphone detection

Features

* vehicle number
* vehicle type
* vehicle speed
+ lane position
++ no changes to road needed 
++ no data infra needed
++ no power infra needed
+ low price
+ also capture other relevant data


Audio works rather well for traffic density
Vehicular Traffic Density State Estimation Based on Cumulative Road Acoustics
