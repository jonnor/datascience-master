# Machine Learning 2

## TODO

* Implement DNN/MLP inference in C for embedded. `emnet`?


## CNN

[Visualizing what ConvNets learn](http://cs231n.github.io/understanding-cnn/).
Visualizing feature map activations, weights, showing inputs that maximally activate a neuron,
t-SNE embedding to show similarity in learned model space, occluding patches of input to find which parts of input are critical
