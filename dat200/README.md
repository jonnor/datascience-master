## Distributed hyperparameter search

Existing work

* [Dask GridSearchCV](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/05/dask-searchcv-distributed-hyperparameter-optimization-scikit-learn.html)
* [Apache Spark GridSeachCV](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/02/08/auto-scaling-scikit-learn-with-apache-spark.html)
* Hard to do on AWS lambda, because sklearn is bigger than Lambda code limit of 50MB

Could do something similar as a Python module, for instance using Heroku API.

Job inputs:
- (git revision)
- Model hyperparameters
- test train/splits

Job outputs:
- inputs
- git revision
- training accurancy
- testing accuracy
- classification outputs (on compete)

Job generator
- can run locally

Job output saver
- can run locally

Autoscaler
- can run locally


## Machine learning on embedded/microcontroller

Implement inference/prediction part of an algorithm for microcontroller.
Using sklearn for the training, serialized and then deserialized again.
DecisionTreeClassifier?

Bonsay is tree-based algorithm. Relatively powerful nodes to enable short trees (reduce RAM usage).
Uses sparse trees, and the final prediction is a sum of all the nodes (path-based).

### On-edge processing cases

ML-learning tasks

* Classification
* regression
* predicion
* Outlier/novelty/anomaly detection

More valuabel when

* High bandwidth sensor input.
Audio, video, IMU
* Rare events
* Low bandwidth algorithm output
* Unreliable connection
* Low cost senor unit
* Low energy usage needed
* Low/predictable latency needed
* Local response needed
* Sending raw sensor data has privacy implications.
Audio, video

Example usecases

* Predictive maintenance, using audio/vibration data
* Activitity detection for people, using audio/accelerometer data
