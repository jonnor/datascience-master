# TIP260: Digital fabrication 2

## Project
Feasibility study on how Moss port can

## Background
Modernization of commercial cargo port in Moss,
using a nearby "dryport" where most of the cargo is stored. 
On-demand transportation, with high degree of automation.

Considerations

* How to create an efficient system?
* How to minimize negative impact on the city?

Understanding the problem

* How long are containers stored at the port? Averages,distribution.
Which factor drives this up/down? How can these be influenced?

## TODO

* Write definition for Terminal Operating System

* Write technical review of traffic sensors.
Traffic sensors, GPS in truck
* Write technical review of environment senors

* IMAGE: Map of sensors. Traffic,environment
* IMAGE: Dashboard frontpage mockup


## Management system

Keywords

* Container Terminal Operations
* terminal operating system (TOS)
* container terminal operating system
* terminal automation

## Key term
Terminal Operating System

A Terminal Operating Sytem (TOS) is a software application tailored for managing shipping terminal operations.
Its primary purpose is to track the movement of cargo in the port.
A real-time TOS can use data from asset tracking systems to 
automatically keep an updated location of goods and machines.
Common added functionality include gate control and billing.

Using reports from data collected in the TOS, terminal operators can
analyze effectivity and plan improvements. 

Using Electronic Data Exchange (EDI) shipment information can be automatically communicated 
between Terminal Operator, Freight Forwarder and Shipping Line.


### Aspects

* Inventory tracking. Containers, location
* vessel operation
* loading or unloading operations
* Yard Planning
* Yard management. Tracking machines moving around. Warehouse levels
Container stacking, localization
* gate operations
Inland port transportation
Truck management 
* Communication with external actors.
Electronic data interchange (EDI)

## External actors

    Terminal Operators
    Freight forwarder

## Datapoints

Average time for container pickup. 4.1 days. Source

In our analysis 100% of containers go to the inland port

## Optimization approach

If wanting to optimize the port operation using machine learning,
what data would be needed.

## GPS tracking

## Aspects
Wetport-dryport


## Questions
Thats needs to be answered,
either in daily opertions
or in planning


When should we move containers from/to wetport?
How many trucks/drivers do we need for internal transport?

How much area is needed in wetport?

What are our impacts on traffic,pollution? How to minimize?

## Understanding the problem
Where does containers go/come from?
Are there fixed lines between harbours

When does customer pick up the container to get it out of port?
Same day, same week?

## Maybe useful

## Notes Jun 26


Inland port first
Minimize seaport
Technological solutions to make this possible

Traffic looks doable from capacity
How small can the port become.
What benefits does this have
! economic. Depends on ability to charge customers more

Picking service. Move to inland

Faster pickup time
Communicate ideal pickup time to Forwarder.


## RTG versus forkflift comparison

Space utilization. Smaller space. Could calculate based on the type Oslo has
Taller than forklifts
Might not be able to stack so high. Is it a regulatory limit?
Investment costs

## Internal transporation
Do we need to run also at night? Looks like no
How much does electric trucks improve noise?
What are regulations for running at night?
