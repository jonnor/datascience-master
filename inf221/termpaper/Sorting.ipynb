    "\n",
    "Test data should be automatically generated. As default items to be sorted, use NumPy arrays filled with integers, but also use strings. Test at least with the following types of data\n",

    "Results should contain notebook cells generating benchmark data and graphics showing that data, including brief descriptions of the observations.\n",

    "ou should attempt going to at least 1 million entries, except for insertion sort, where you probably need to stop for much smaller data sizes\n",
