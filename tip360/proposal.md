Value prop..

TODO: background

Wireless Acoustic Sensor Network (WASN)
Internet of Things (IoT)


## Deliverables
The main deliverable is a Design Document which specifies

* Requirements and desirable characteristics of a WASN
* Targeted usecases and scope of solution 
* Design choices made, including their background
* Overall system architecture
* Chosen technology for system components

Design aspects are expected to include:

* Network architecture and communication method
* Sensor nodes
* Data storage
* Data processing architecture
* Data analysis methods

## Activities
The project is comprised of the following key activities

* Gathering Requirements 
* Review of available technology 
* Review of academic literature
* Modelling of key design choices
* Writing the Design Document
