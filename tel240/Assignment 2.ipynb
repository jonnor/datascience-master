    "Here are some questions about the PID-controller. Use your own words.\n",
    "\n",
    "> (a) Why a pure P-controller will generate stationary error/offset when used for\n",
    "most of the existing systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "A P-controller applies output proportional to the error. For many systems this will reach a equlibrium *near* the setpoint, but never reaching it. As Kp gain is higher one can get closer, but at risk of overshoot or instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "> (b) Why the addition of the integral term may remove the stationary error in most\n",
    "of the cases?\n",
    "\n",
    "A stationary error will, if not removed, cause the integral of the error to grow over time.\n",
    "With an I-controller high integral values causes it to take action to counteract, which elimitates the stationary error. \n",
    "\n",
    "> (c) Which controller is the fastest and what controller is the slowest among the\n",
    "pure P-controller, I-controller and D-controller? What does this mean for\n",
    "systems with high-frequency motion and systems with low frequency motion?\n",
    "\n",
    "P is faster than I, as I requires values to build up over time. D is theoretically faster than P, as its value suggests potential future values of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a fast system is needed and a bit of stationary error is acceptable and measurement/process noise is low, a PD controller can be used. If a system does is OK with slow response time, one can use a PI regulator. Not using a D-term can make the system more stable in presence of noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "> (d) What is the main motivation for introducing the D-gain in the controller? Can\n",
    "you suggest another way to achieve the same effect you described?\n",
    "\n",
    "The D-gain is used to counteract oscillations around the setpoint. As a system with inertia or time-delay has been set into motion towards a setpoint, the amount of should be reduced before one gets to the setpoint - or overshoot will happen. The P term does not do this fast enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "> (e) Sum up the main effects of each term P, I and D individually on: (i) response\n",
    "time; (ii) stationary error/offset; (iii) overshoot; (iv) noise; (v) stability\n",
