A Terminal Operating Sytem (TOS) is a software application tailored for managing shipping terminal operations.
Its primary purpose is to track the movement of cargo in the port.
A real-time TOS can use data from asset tracking systems to 
automatically keep an updated location of goods and machines.
Common added functionality include gate control and billing.

Using reports from data collected in the TOS, terminal operators can
analyze effectivity and plan improvements. 

Using Electronic Data Exchange (EDI) shipment information can be automatically communicated 
between Terminal Operator, Freight Forwarder and Shipping Line.

## Optimization approach

If wanting to optimize the port operation using machine learning,
what data would be needed.

## GPS tracking


GPS truck tracking

Tracking the position of transport trucks over time with a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit
can be used to know exactly where the trucks travel. In a real-time GPS systems with wireless connectivity
this data is available immediately to the logistics operator.
When used by a logistic organisation, such tracking often go under the umbrella term Fleet Management.

The historical data can be used to calculate the typical
and maximum expected transport time from location A to B,
to be used when planning.
Using machine learning, a prediction model can be built,
giving predictions for a specific day and time of day.
The data can be further used to pinpoint problematic areas along the road,
suggesting alternative routes.
Data can then be provided to road authorities when discussing need for improvements.

Due to privacy of the truck drivers GPS tracking use in Norwegian industry
is regulated by Datatilsynet. However usage is allowed for Fleet Management provided that certain conditions are met.
https://www.datatilsynet.no/samfunnsomrader/personvern-pa-arbeidsplassen/gps-sporing_yrkesbiler/

GPS systems are available in many new trucks (Volvo Dynafleet, Scania Fleet Management, MAN Telematics),
or can be installed on existing trucks via a third-party addon (iTracker, Ecofleet).
To facilitate data integration with Terminal Operation System, a real-time GPS
with an Application Programming Interface (API) is preferred.

## Environmental sensors

## Noise sensors

Noise Monitoring is traditionally done by a sound technician using a handheld device
or stationary device for some hours. Afterwards a written report is delivered.
The labour intensive nature means it is costly to perform each measurement.
As a consequence noise measurements are done seldom and covering only few locations. 

Noise Monitoring Terminals are stationary sensors that continiously measure noise
and report to a central system over a wireless connection (WiFi,3G).
Products suitable for monitoring of outdoor environment include
CESVA TA120, Urbiotica U-Sound and Norsonic Nor1531.
Event triggers can be set up to warn when sound levels exceed a defined threshold.
This enables proactive stance to noise pollution, which
makes it easier to respond to complaints and verify compliance with regulations.

## Air Quality

Pollution in the air is produced by a range of sources, including transportation vechiles and industrial processes.
A number of health problems like heart disease, stroke and lung cancer are highly related to air pollution.
People breathing in air of poor quality could suffer from difficulty in breathing, coughing, wheezing and asthma.
This can affect both workers of a site, and other people frequenting in the surrounding area.

Because of this the EU has introduces target and limit values for a number of harmful pollutants.

TABLE

Low-cost sensors that can detect many of these pollutants have become available over the last years.
Either designed as a portable device for personal use, or for autonomous stationary operation in a Wireless Sensor Network.
These supplement official measuring stations which give very high quality measurements,
but very limited resolution in time and space due to their costs.
While data quality of low-cost sensors remains a challenge, the higher resolution can give
useful insights in the variation of pollution and possible patterns.
The data can be used for early warning systems, or be analyzed to determine root causes.

Example of low-cost Air Quality Monitors for real-time continious monitoring include
Aeroqual Dust Profiler and AQMesh.

MDPI Special Issue, August 2017
In the last five years, the emergence of small-scale air quality sensors has led to a significant paradigm shift in the approach to measuring air quality beyond those afforded by traditional methods that use large, stationary, and expensive analyzers.  These sensors are, not only small, but also can be portable, providing data in near-real time at relatively low costs and using low amounts of power. As a result, sensors allow air quality to be measured with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution, transforming the way we understand our environment.

Sensors are currently available or being developed to measure ambient concentrations of air pollutants found in air,
e.g., NO, NO2, O3, CO2, CO, CH4, VOC, organic species,
as well as particulate matter (PM) mass in one or more size ranges and components of PM, e.g., black carbon. 

Measuring air pollution with low-cost sensors
https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/brochures-leaflets/measuring-air-pollution-low-cost-sensors

Low-cost air quality sensors are attracting more and more attention
They offer air pollution monitoring at a lower cost than conventional methods,
making air quality monitoring possible in many more locations.

"By using calibration coefficient equal to the averages of the effects given in this report, reasonable calibration function could be established.
This result is promising, allowing for future increase of the use of sensors for low cost for air pollution monitoring both by expert institutes and citizen science projects"

Heart disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),
stroke and lung cancer are highly related to air pollution.
People breathing in air of poor quality could suffer from difficulty in breathing, coughing, wheezing and asthma.

Benefits of continuous real-time monitoring
Traditional sampling methods like high volume samplers are great for accurate measurement of dust and particulate matter at a fixed point in time or over a 24 hour period, but they cannot indicate exactly when an emissions event occurred. An industrial site needs to know immediately when a problem has occurred so they can put into practice control measures.

https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-08/documents/ron_williams-presentation_4_21.pdf

Value of Continuous Measures
â€¢ Provides greater understanding of time and location changes
of environmental conditions
â€¢ Has the potential of defining critical episodic events that
would otherwise not be discovered
â€¢ Helps to define the validity of the data measurement itself
â€¢ Needed anytime a mobile measurement is required

The European Air Quality Directive (EU, 2008) defines the Data Quality Objective (DQO) that monitoring methods need to comply with to be used as indicative measurements for regulative purposes. The DQO is a measure of the acceptable uncertainty for indicative measurements. According to the Directive, allowed uncertainties are 50% for PM10 and PM2.5, 30% for O3 and 25% for CO, NOx, NO2 and SO2.

necessary to perform a field calibration for each sensor individually
NO, PM10 and PM2.5, the expanded uncertainty meets the DQO criteria as defined in the Air Quality Directive
However, other pollutants, e.g., CO, NO2 and O3, show a highly expanded uncertainty that exceeded the DQO for indicative methods
recent studies show that the application of field calibrations based on machine learning techniques can reduce the expanded uncertainty

Good indicator of trends in time

Review of Portable and Low-Cost Sensors for the Ambient Air Monitoring of Benzene and Other Volatile Organic Compounds
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5539520/
2017 Jun 

In Europe, the European Air Quality Directive (AQD [3]) defines as mandatory the monitoring of benzene in ambient air. The AQD states that the reference method for the measurement of BTEX consists of active or on-line sampling followed by desorption and gas chromatography [4]. This method is time consuming, expensive to implement and it needs skilled personnel to perform complex operations.

## Notes Jun 26


Inland port first
Minimize seaport
Technological solutions to make this possible

Traffic looks doable from capacity
How small can the port become.
What benefits does this have
! economic. Depends on ability to charge customers more

Picking service. Move to inland

Faster pickup time
Communicate ideal pickup time to Forwarder.


## RTG versus forkflift comparison

Space utilization. Smaller space. Could calculate based on the type Oslo has
Taller than forklifts
Might not be able to stack so high. Is it a regulatory limit?
Investment costs
