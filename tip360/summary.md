# Executive Summary

Environmental noise is the second most common environmental
cause of health problems in Europe. Over 8 million people are
estimated to experience sleep disturbances from road traffic alone.
This report details a proposed design of a sensor node for continious
sound level monitoring with production, installation and operational
costs each under 1000 NOK. The sensor uses a low-power
battery-driven system and cellular network for data transmission.
It can report daily sound-level measurements with per-minute resolution,
and sample noise details data of loud sounds for automatic noise source
identification using machine learning.
Development of a prototype to validate the design has been started,
but not yet completed or tested.
