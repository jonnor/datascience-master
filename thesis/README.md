# Machine Learning on Microcontrollers
Initial research happening in [EmbeddedML](./embeddedml),
to be distilled into a Master Thesis here.

## TODO

* December: Propose concrete topic, problem statement
* January: Decide topic

## Possible formats

- Develop an adapter/novel method for microcontroller use.
- Compare different existing methods, on existing datasets.
emlearn.
- Tackle a concrete problem that someone has.
Coffeebeans.
