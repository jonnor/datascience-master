## Machine learning on embedded/microcontroller

Implement inference/prediction part of an algorithm for microcontroller.
Using sklearn for the training, serialized and then deserialized again.
DecisionTreeClassifier?

Bonsay is tree-based algorithm. Relatively powerful nodes to enable short trees (reduce RAM usage).
Uses sparse trees, and the final prediction is a sum of all the nodes (path-based).

### On-edge processing cases

ML-learning tasks

* Classification
* regression
* predicion
* Outlier/novelty/anomaly detection

More valuabel when

* High bandwidth sensor input.
Audio, video, IMU
* Rare events
* Low bandwidth algorithm output
* Unreliable connection
* Low cost senor unit
* Low energy usage needed
* Low/predictable latency needed
* Local response needed
* Sending raw sensor data has privacy implications.
Audio, video

Example usecases

* Predictive maintenance, using audio/vibration data
* Activitity detection for people, using audio/accelerometer data
