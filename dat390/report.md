## Introduction to sound

- Digital recording sound
- Acoustics
- Psychoacoustics
- Biological models sound production in animals

## Applications
of machine learning on sound

Connected problems and fields:

- vibration data
- time-series
- speech recognition
- music information retrieval

## Problems formulations

Classification
Detection
Identifying individual

Monophonic,polyphonic
Multi-label

## Feature representations
Criterias for good features

### Low-level features
spectral center, spectral slope etc

### Time-frequency representations
STFT, windowing
mel-spectrogram
MFCC

delta, lag/lead frames
Summarizations on spectrograms

### Biologically based
Coclear models

### Wavelet based
Wavelet filterbanks
Scattering transform

### Representation learning
Convolutional kernels

### Convolutional neural networks
Shallow, deep.

## Data augmentations
Respects invariants/properties of features

## Comparative study
On DCASE2018 bird-detection
