# Wireless Acoustic Sensor Network
for monitoring of animal livestock and wildlife

A Wireless Acoustic Sensor Network (WASN) is a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)
where each sensor node captures audio data and transmits the acoustic information
to central system for processing and reporting.

The information can be used to provide information regarding the health of livestock animals in farming,
including detection of distress, early-warnings for certain diseases and when animals are in heat.
In wildlife acoustic information can be used to estimate and analyze population of mammals and birds,
in agricultural, rural and urban environments.

## Motivation

Recent advances in Machine Learning, both generally and on audio data specifically,
means that more information can be extracted from sound data and acoustic phenomenons.
However such methods require very large amounts of varied data in order to perform well,
often missing to support usecases.
Today most data in agriculture and environmental areas are both collected and analyzed manually.
The labour-intensive nature means that sensors are only available occationally,
giving poor data coverage of common events and often missing rare phenomena (like disease) completely.

A Wireless Sensor Network will, once deployed, collect and transmit data automatically and regularly.
This makes it feasible to aquire the large amount and range of data that is needed in a cost-effective manner.
Futhermore the data can be processed and analysed online, to generate easily available information that is always up to date.
This way it can assist in everyday decision making.

## Project Partners

Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) is Norway leading university
in food, environmental protection and sustainable use of natural resources.
NMBU participates in many research project that aims to bring improvements to the agricultural industry.
One such project is the Future Farm project, where an industry participant has expressed interest
in using acoustic sensors for monitoring livestock in poultry farming.

Nordby Technology A/S is a technology company that creates and invests in software and electronics to build IoT solutions.
Current subsidiaries include Flowhub UG, a Software-as-a-Service company that provides software development tools for IoT.
The company now wishes to evaluate the technical feasibility of wireless acoustic sensors combined with audio analytics based on machine learning. 


## Deliverables
The main deliverable is a Design Document which specifies:

* Requirements and desirable characteristics of a WASN
* Targeted usecases and scope of solution 
* Design choices made, including their background
* Overall system architecture
* Chosen technology for system components

Design aspects are expected to include:

* Network architecture and communication method
* Sensor nodes
* Data storage
* Data processing architecture
* Data analysis methods

## Dissemination
The Design Document is to be available for *internal* use by NMBU for any purpose,
including for evaluation in the TIP360 course.
Any other sharing of the deliverables is up to Nordby Technology A/S.
It is expected that the report will be published as a technical whitepaper,
possibly after some additional editing or redactions.


## Activities
The project is comprised of the following key activities

* Gathering Requirements 
* Review of available technology 
* Review of academic literature
* Modelling of key design choices
* Writing the Design Document
