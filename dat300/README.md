# Machine Learning 2

## TODO

* emnet: Implement `convert()` for (simple) Keras models
* emnet: Add support for convolutional layers (Keras)
* Try to pre-seed convolution kernel parameters. Etc from spherical k-means, or random, or know (Gabor?)

## CNN

[Visualizing what ConvNets learn](http://cs231n.github.io/understanding-cnn/).
Visualizing feature map activations, weights, showing inputs that maximally activate a neuron,
t-SNE embedding to show similarity in learned model space, occluding patches of input to find which parts of input are critical
