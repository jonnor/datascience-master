## Ideas

* Image Processing/analysis using imgflo/GEGL
* Image Processing, [smart-cad](https://github.com/jonnor/projects/tree/master/smart-cad) prototyping
* FBP/NoFlo execution for Jupyter. Kernel?. .fbp renderer, component/JavaScript evaluator
* Energy usage at Bitraf/c-base, relative to weather. Anomaly detection, reporting/monitoring
* CNC usage at Bitraf. How many of the jobs/parts can be done on a 60x120 cm workarea machine. Take gcode/dxfs from Dropbox, analyse
* Integrated data visualization for programming, [dataviz](https://github.com/jonnor/projects/tree/master/introspectable-computing/dataviz)
* Modelling of guitar distortion (non-linear). Using neural-network? 
* Automatic part layout of useful parts in remainder of cutsheet for CNC/laser. Automatic creation of cutlines to discard pieces smaller than w,h.
* Using machine learning to (assist in) reverse engineering protocols for machine control. Record input, output pairs. Change

## Publishing

Is TapeCore/Doverail/fabricatable-machines publishable in Open Hardware Journal?
https://openhardware.metajnl.com/about/#hardware-metapapers
Could I do the work as a 5-point self-organized topic (ie in robotics)?
Can/should I use NMBU as affiliation? Would they sponsor the publishing costs?
Would/should there be research uses at NMBU for testing practical application?
