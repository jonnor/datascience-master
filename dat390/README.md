Independent study in chosen topic in Data Science

## Goals

Prepare for master thesis work

* Get comfortable executing machine learning research
* Setup and test workflow for report writing and publishing
* Build background knowledge
* Ideas for usecase/case-study in thesis

## Outputs

* Nov15: Presentation given for Data Science class
* Dec 1: Finished report
* One or more demonstrations (video/browser)
* Report(s) published as HTML
* Couple of blogposts

## Topic

[Machine hearing](../machinehearing). Machine learning on audio data.

* Speech recognition
* Music Information Retrieval
* **Acoustic event detection**

## Scope

Focus on: Acoustic Event Detection. Animals. ecoacoustics/bioacoustics

Focus on: Robust methods, can be used in real-life noisy environments.
Efficient methods, can be implemented in embedded system.

Activities:

* ML model based on existing data (DCASE2018)
* Implement ML model in C for microcontroller
* ?Demo: detect birdsong live
* MAYBE? comparative study AED methods, on micro/birdsong.
Spectrogram summarizations.
Feature learning on spectrogram.
Shallow neural networks.
Deep-learning. CNN

Out of scope

* Collect own data

### Machine hearing overview
