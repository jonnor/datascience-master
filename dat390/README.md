Independent study in chosen topic in Data Science

## Goals

Prepare for master thesis work

* Get comfortable executing machine learning research.
Comparing model alternatives. Accuracy, training time, inference time, data requirements
* Setup and test workflow for report writing and publishing
* Build background knowledge
* Ideas for usecase/case-study in thesis

## Outputs

* Nov15: Presentation given for Data Science class
* Dec 1: Finished report
* One or more demonstrations (video/browser)
* Report(s) published as HTML
* Couple of blogposts

## Topic

[Machine hearing](../machinehearing). Machine learning on audio data.

* **Acoustic event detection**
* (Speech recognition)
* (Music Information Retrieval)

## Scope

Focus on

* Acoustic Event Detection. Animals. Ecoacoustics/bioacoustics
* Robust methods, can be used in real-life noisy environments
* Efficient methods, possible to implement in embedded system

Only covered briefly

* Psycoacoustics
* Biological models of sound production

Out of scope

* Collect own data
* Implementing on microcontroller

## Activities:

1. Read literature and summarizing 
2. Comparative study AED methods. On birdsong, DCASE2018 dataset
