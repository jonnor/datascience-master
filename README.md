## Ideas

Flowhub related

* From Jupyter to cloud-scale service using msgflo-python
* FBP/NoFlo execution for Jupyter. Kernel?. .fbp renderer, component/JavaScript evaluator
* Integrated data visualization for programming, [dataviz](https://github.com/jonnor/projects/tree/master/introspectable-computing/dataviz)

Basic data science applications

* Energy usage at Bitraf/c-base, relative to weather. Anomaly detection, reporting/monitoring
* CNC usage at Bitraf. How many of the jobs/parts can be done on a 60x120 cm workarea machine. Take gcode/dxfs from Dropbox, analyse
* Predicting likelyhood of someone opening for guests upon ringing the doorbell.

Machine learning

* Modelling of guitar distortion (non-linear). Using neural-network? Some work already done
* Assist in reverse engineering of protocols, for example for machine control (Shopbot,Redsail).
Record input, output pairs. Change input parameters, find corresponding change in output.

Larger projects, potentially novel

* Machine-vision-assisted construction of . [smart-cad](https://github.com/jonnor/projects/tree/master/smart-cad)
* Automation of CAM paths for maximizing material usage and waste management. Machine-vision
Automatic part layout of useful parts in remainder of cutsheet for CNC/laser.
Automatic creation of cutlines to discard pieces smaller than w,h.
Can a greedy algorithm perform well for part layout, ie does the problem have optimal substructure?

* Component-based PCB autolayout & routing
Reusable modules with pre-laidout schematic/board snippets for a given functionality.
Autolayout by placing modules as black-box rectangles/polygons.
Using reduction in netlist size (implicit ignoring local connections) for better autorouting.
But this can be detected via strongly connected components of the graph?
Note, one can also use [Planarity_testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planarity_testing) to determine subgraphs
which can be laid out without 
Using contraints to express requirements, solving to autosuggest sub-circuit solutions.
http://www.electronicdesign.com/what-s-difference-between/what-s-difference-pcb-routing-then-and-now

Robotics

* Analyzing low-cost motion systems.
Using force-sensors on motors/actuator/effector and recording data at high speed
Perform tests on running different kind of jobs.
Measure: static/dynamic friction, coefficient.
Forces due to acceleration.
Forces working back on effector (CNC milling).
Slop. Backlash.
Compare with simulated data, detect anomalies.
Compare different technologies/techniques .
Use to guide development of ultra-low-cost, reprap-style, motion systems.
Note, friction coefficient very dependent on how tight bearings are.
Slop/precision also dependent on this. Especially for plain-bearings.
Should at least measure slop. For instance measure force needed to rotate N degrees?
Could try to tune slop to be same for doing comparative studies?
HEX711 IC commonly used only allows for 80 samples/second.
Would need. A load-cell is a Weathstone bridge, so an instrumentation amplifier is way to go.
ADC can be done in a fast microcontroller. STM32 etc.
Example circuit based on INA125, instrumentation amp with precision voltage reference included:
http://www.mechtechplace.net/mech-tech-electronics/building-a-low-cost-strain-gage-load-cell-amplifier/
INA125 has 4.5kHz bandwith @ 100x gain, should be good for 1k+ samples/second.

* Recycling, waste-management
* Manufacturing, low-scale automation. Cheap robotics and deployment
* Agriculture, food-production
* Understanding and predicting impacts (economic,social,environmental)
* Co-op organization for achieving scale where automation gives good return-of-investment.
Useful outputs as primary dividends. Competitive with buying the goods on-the-market.
Secondary dividends profits made from selling surplus capacity.
Slight premiums possible for additional convenience, and transparency (environmental,economical,social).
Costs: Development, build/setup, operating costs. Marginal costs, and size between each scaling step.
Is machine tending compatible with another job? Software engineering?

Demand:
What high-value (ref production cost) things do people need a lot of?
Staple foods are consumed a lot, but low-value?
Spices are consumed regularly but in small amounts, and semi-high value. Garlic, chillies, oregany?
Fruits and vegetables are relatively high value versus staples, and underconsumed.
Medicines are very high value. Some need them a lot, but most don't? Challenging regulations,safety
What about vitamins/supplements, can often be underconsumed?
What can be provided consistently (all-year)?
What can be stored efficiently? So that variation in supply/demand can be evened out.

Reinforcement learning is different from supervised methods. The agent observes its environment and performs actions on it.
It observes the outcome of its actions and compares this with desired outcome.
Current RL algorithms are fully generic (mathematically). They can get superhuman performance, but the learning efficiency is very low.
Can we make it more efficient by making use of particular information about the environment. Ie: obey our laws of physics
Can we meta-reinformcement learn? That let the agent learn to reinformcement learn?
Using Recurrent Neural Net as a generic compute achitecture, with both compute and storage ability. 
Evaluating on Multi-armed bandit problem, and known asymptomatically optimall algorithm.
Currently meta-learning works 2/3 of the time. Reasons for not working inlclude overfitting (or underfitting), and insufficient signal.
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning.
Imitation learning. Many success stories in robotics. Human shows how to perform task, agent learns the policy.
Lifelong learning. Instead of only training/learning up-front, will learn continiously after deployment.
Simulation is very important. Huge advantages to training in real world.
Challenge is for the learnings in simulation to transfer over into real world.
One approach is randomized simulation domains. With enough variation - even when not high fidelity,
allows to train agent which performs well on real-life scenario without any real-life training data.

When performed in CIE-Lab gives very natural blurring, not introducing new colors. Also preserves edges and shadows well.
Can be applied iteratively, which effectively reduces the amount of colors present. Reducing/removing texture.
Could be used as a pre-processing step to color quantize an image?

* Search a problemsolving for fully-observable,deterministic,known environments.
Solution is a sequence of actions that lead to the goal.
`SMA*`, simplified memory-limited A* graph search. Optimal with *admissible* heuristic, and a robust solution for many problems.
Challenge is in defining a good heuristic function (and meaningful path distances).
Must be non-negative, never overestimate, respect 'triangle equality', and h(goal) = 0.
The heuristic determines overall performance, and can be evaluated by looking at the effective branching factor on example problems.
How many nodes are evaluated versus path length to reach a solution. Should be quite small.
One method for developing heuristic is to transform the problem to a simplified version, by removing restrictions/rules.
If the problem is defined in a formal language, it is possible to automatically derive such simplified versions.
One can use a composed heuristic function which takes the max of a family of heuristic functions.
Heuristics can also be made using a database of solutions to subproblems.
Heuristics can be learned by creating a prediction model between feature(s) of a state and the distance to the goal.
When using multiple features, often use linear weighted combinations to get one number.

## Interesting subproblems

Neural networks

* When used on images incredibly texture dependent. For instance cause vunerability to adverserial examples.
How to mitigate? Learning rate influences, higher rate, more noise.
Could one reduce by automatically generating variants of the training inputs?.
For instance on images, use smoothening filters, color changes, brightness/contrast changes, noise addition, scaling, rotating.
Also maybe helps with small datasets, especially for supervised learning (where labeling is expensive).
* Seem that there is a lot of 'unecessary' complexity/information being encoded, that are irrelevant to the objective at hand.
How can one know how much complexity is needed to perform a particular function? How to estimate that it is well spent?
Are there information-theory approaches that can be applied?
